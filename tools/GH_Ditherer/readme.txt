GearHead Sprite Ditherer v1.0
------------------------
by Michael Horvath

Description
-----------
This utility is a front-end for ImageMagick. It converts an image with alpha-channel transparency to an flattened image with dithered transparency.

Note
----
The file with the '.hta' extension is the actual application.

Warning
-------
This utility overwrites the source images; so, make backup copies, first.
