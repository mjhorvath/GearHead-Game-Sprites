The wollowing three effects do not work in POV-Ray version 3.7:

* Projectile_Bullet.pov
* Projectile_Flamethrower.pov
* Explosion_Volatile.pov

They need to be rendered in POV-Ray 3.6 instead.

Most of these effects were taken from the Web and are not under the same license 
as the rest of the effects.
